# ComicCon-Register-Website
This website was built as a registration and survey page for my university's yearly comic con.

## About
I built this webpage to be used by my university for their yearly comic con. Users can register, their data is captured and then they can fill in a survey about the comic con. This project also includes the email that would have been sent to registered users. 

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- PHP

## Setup
You will need to host this with an Apache Server and have the MySQL server also running. You can use XAMPP for this. Make sure to setup a local database with the SQL I provided as part of this repo.

I know the code is open to SQL injection attacks, but this was purely for data capture of non-sensitive data.
